It’s important to have knowledge about common skin conditions such as acne, eczema, psoriasis, rosacea, and dermatitis.

                                <p>
                                    Acne is a common skin condition characterized by the presence of pimples, blackheads, whiteheads, and sometimes cysts. It occurs when hair follicles become clogged with oil and dead skin cells. Hormonal changes, genetics, and certain medications can contribute to acne. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, including redness, inflammation, and the formation of pus-filled lesions. Treatment options include topical creams, medications, and advanced procedures like laser therapy. Maintaining a proper skincare routine, including gentle cleansing and avoiding excessive use of oil-based products, can help prevent acne breakouts.

                                <p>
                                    Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that causes itching, redness, and dryness of the skin. The exact cause of eczema is still unknown, but a combination of genetic and environmental factors is believed to play a role. Common triggers include allergens, irritants, stress, and changes in climate. Managing eczema often involves using moisturizers, topical corticosteroids, and antihistamines to alleviate symptoms. Avoiding triggers and practicing good skincare habits, such as regular moisturization, can help prevent flare-ups.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Psoriasis is an autoimmune disorder that speeds up the growth cycle of skin cells, resulting in the formation of thick, red, scaly patches. The exact cause of psoriasis remains unclear, but it is thought to involve genetic and environmental factors. Symptoms may include itching, pain, and cracked skin. Treatment options range from topical medications to phototherapy, oral medications, and biologic injections. Managing triggers like stress, infections, and certain medications can help control psoriasis symptoms and reduce flare-ups.

                                <p>
                                    Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition primarily affecting the face, characterized by redness, visible blood vessels, and sometimes pimples or bumps. Although the exact cause is unknown, factors like genetics, sun exposure, spicy foods, and alcohol consumption can exacerbate symptoms. Treatment often involves the use of topical creams, oral medications, and laser therapy to manage redness and control flare-ups. Protecting the skin from the sun and avoiding triggers can help prevent rosacea flare-ups.
